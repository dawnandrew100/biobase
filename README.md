# Biobase
A home for all biological/bioinformatics constants from protein strings to BLOSUM matrices.

## Translation
Currently all amino acids (names, one letter codes, and three letter codes) are available as public variables. There is also a codon table and a dictionary displaying how many codons make each amino acid.

I intended to add functions that allow for the conversion between amino acid names, one letter codes, and three letter codes.

## Goals
This project is primarily so I don't have to constantly create python friendly versions of biological constants when answering questions on Rosalind but hopefully this will eventually become one of my PyPI projects with Goombay!
